Introduction:

In this lab you will be developing a server that stores data for a school. The school has the following data models:

Classes
Students
Classes
We will be storing each individual class as a file on the server in the folder /classes.
The name of the class will match the name of the file. Example: Class physics will be stored as the file /classes/physics.json.
The class file will be stored as a .json file extension. The data in it will be a JSON object.
The JSON object will basically hold an array of students.
This is how the file should look:
{
  students: [
    { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'NYC', grade: 75 },
    { name: 'Emily', age: 28, city: 'LA', grade: 80 }
  ]
}
Students
Each student will be a JSON object that stores four data points:
name
age
city
grade
The same student can exist in multiple classes.
Routes & Functionality
Adding Students to a Class
GET localhost:3000/class/add/?class=physics&name=John&age=30&city=NYC&grade=75
Create the class file if it doesn't already exist
If file exists, add a new user object to the class file's array
The GET request must pass all four data points for the user to store into the file
If the student name already exists, UPDATE/REWRITE the students information with the new data passed
A successful response should look like:

{ 
  added: { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'NYC', grade: 75 }
  class: 'physics'
}
An error response should look like:

{ 
  error: 'Please fill out all the information for the student'
}
List All Students in a Class
GET localhost:3000/class/list/?class=physics
Check if the class file exists, if not give an error response
If class file exists show the list of students
{
  students: [
    { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'NYC', grade: 75 },
    { name: 'Emily', age: 28, city: 'LA', grade: 80 }
  ]
}
An error response should look like:

{ 
  error: 'Class physicslol doesn't exist.'
}
List Failing Students
GET localhost:3000/class/listfailing/?class=physics
Check if the class file exists, if not give an error response
If class file exists show the list of students who are scoring less than 50
{
  students: [
    { name: 'Bob', age: 30, city: 'MIA', grade: 49 }
  ]
}
An error response should look like:

{ 
  error: 'Class physicslol doesn't exist.'
}
List Students from a Specific City
GET localhost:3000/class/listfromcity/?class=physics&city=MIA
Check if the class file exists, if not give an error response
If class file exists show the list of students who are from the entered city
If a city is passed that doesn't match any students, just pass an empty array of students
{
  students: [
    { name: 'Bob', age: 30, city: 'MIA', grade: 49 }
  ]
}
An error response should look like:

{ 
  error: 'Class physicslol doesn't exist.'
}
